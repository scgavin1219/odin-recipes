     <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I was trying to get a little fancy with my plum pie
            recipe, but that's not really who I am in the
            kitchen. I am not about taste, flavor, or aesthetics. 
            Food should be prepared and devoured efficiently and 
            the <em>quese-dylan</em> delivers. 
        </p>

        <p>The best part about this recipe is that you can literally 
            add any ingredients you want. Add some veggies, add some
            tomato sauce and pepperonis and make a mexican pizza. 
            The kitchen is yours and do whatever you want in it. 
            Let's get cooking baby!
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>tortillas</li>
                <li>pepperjack cheese</li>
                <li>LITERALLY WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pre-heat a cast-iron (don't use some bullshit
                    non-stick pan, it doesn't heat the quesedilla 
                    evenly!) to medium heat.
                </li>
                <li>Put one tortilla in the pan and sprinkle 
                    pepperjack (Don't use any other cheese. It's 
                    pepperjack or nothing. All other chesses are inferior)
                    gratuitously. Add any other ingredients you would like
                    and put a second tortilla on top.
                </li>
                <li>Wait approximately 3 to 4 minutes or until the cheese is
                    apprximately half melted and flip the quesedilla.
                </li>
                <li>Cook for another 3 minutes</li>
                <li>Quarter the quesedilla and eat!</li>
            </ol>
