    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I just moved back home and my house always has 
            about 20 plums in it at a time. My parents love
            stone fruit! Unfortunately, we can't seem to eat 
            them quickly enough and some were starting to spoil. 
            I knew I had to figure out something to do with all 
            the plums, so I looked up this recipe.
        </p>
        <p>This is not a recipe that has been in my family for 
            centuries or even one that my Grandma made me when
            I used to visit. This is simply a recipe for 
            <strong>Plum Pie</strong> that I am going to use to 
            solve the current plum predicament that I'm in currently. 
            Also, hopefully I make an awesome webpage too!
        </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups of sliced plums</li>
            <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 frozen pie crust (9 inches)</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Topping:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>3 tbsp cold butter</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375Â°. In a large bowl, sprinkle 
                plums with lemon juice. Combine sugar, flour, 
                salt and cinnamon. Add to plums; toss gently to coat.
                 Pour into pie shell.</li>
            <li>For topping, in a small bowl, combine sugar, flour, 
                cinnamon and nutmeg; cut in butter until crumbly. 
                Sprinkle over filling.</li>
            <li>Bake until filling is bubbly, 50-60 minutes. Cover 
                edge loosely with foil during the last 20 minutes if 
                needed to prevent overbrowning. Cool on a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>
